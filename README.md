<h1>&#9835; Music Recommender &#9835;</h1>

<h3><i>Unsupervised</i> learning project</h3>

- Checks popularity: If the song is in the Top 100 (Hot!), a random Top 100 song is recommended. <br>
By design, recommendations do not reflect user preferences, as per task instructions.
- If not in Top 100: A similar song is recommended based on the song's scaled audio features, using clustering to find the best match.
